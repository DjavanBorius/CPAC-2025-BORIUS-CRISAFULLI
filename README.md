# CPAC-2025-BORIUS-CRISAFULLI
CPAC project for year 2024-2025, group of 2 with Djavan BORIUS and Andrea CRISAFULLI

Files in processing and TouchDesigner are the code.
To make everything work all devices need to be connected to the same IP adress. Make sure you changed the line related to the OSC messages in the codes (OSC message and project_final)
If you want bespoke feature you can easily modify the class of circle and painting. 
For the TouchDesigner code you need to launch it in the same time as the processing code. If you have a paying version of TouchDesigner you can use the functions Spout of TouchDesigner to collect the 
video in processing.

In the github page you can also find the presentation document as a pdf, the thumnail image and the 3 images of the project.
